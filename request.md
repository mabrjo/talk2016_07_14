Happy Friday!

[12:35]  
We have a student in the Java course that noted: "I can't really think of any as of yet. Maybe hearing about different types of jobs that are available to java developers would be interesting, as it seems like there are a lot of different paths to take."

Would this be a subject you could come in and speak about or could you recommend someone?

I'm happy to talk about this.     Please tell me how long you would like me to speak?   15 minutes will do and I could fill an hour.   I suggest 15 minutes with 15 minutes of Q&A.   Could put it at the end of a class; then people who want more Q&A can stay later than normal.    Please tell me if & when/where you'd like me to speak?    I'd like a full weeks notice (or more), please.   But I can also talk anytime next week if you prefer (i.e. I don't need a weeks notice).

15 minutes to speak and 15 for Q&A is the norm. End of class is 9:30pm and everyone is ready to get home by then so we'll plan for the beginning of class. I'll get the date settled with Kent and let you know asap -- it will probably be tomorrow when I have a date/time and I'll provide the where details as well. :slightly_smiling_face:
